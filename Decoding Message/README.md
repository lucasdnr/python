# Message Decoding Program

## Overview

This Python program is designed to decode messages encoded using a specific scheme. The encoding scheme involves associating words with numerical values and then creating a staircase-like structure from the sorted list of these numerical values.

## Usage

### File Format

The input file is expected to contain pairs of numbers and words, separated by whitespace. Each line of the file represents one pair.

Example:<br>
1 apple<br>
2 banana<br>
3 cherry<br>

### Running the Program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:

3. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Decoding Message
```

4. Run the program using the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python decoding-message.py
```

## Files

- **example.txt:** A encoded text file containing a list of words.
